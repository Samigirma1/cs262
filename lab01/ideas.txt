1. An app that can convert images into music and the vise versa. In other words,
"Listen to your images and look at your music" (wacky)
The concept can be expanded to convert any file into an image that can be scanned
by another phone with the app to retrieve the original file locally.

2. Given a student's ID number, or the list of the students classes and sections, 
an app that retrieves the prices of the textbooks the student needs from Calvin's
books store, reputable online stores, and listings on social media marketplaces 
(like Calvin's "Free & For sell" facebook group)
